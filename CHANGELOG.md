## **[0.7.3] - 2025-04-16**

### ✨ Features
- Added `CoconutFrostedAppBar`, a new `PreferredSizeWidget` variant with blur background, scroll-based title opacity, and dynamic background color adjustment based on scroll.

### ♻️ Refactor
- Unified theming logic by removing `brightness` parameters and using `Theme.of(context).brightness` internally.
- Simplified AppBar button icon rendering using shared asset logic.
- Extracted and renamed internal AppBar builder functions for clarity and modularity:
  - `build()` – general AppBar with optional back/close icon, sublabel, etc.
  - `buildHomeAppbar()` – sliver-based AppBar optimized for home layouts.
  - `buildWithNext()` – AppBar variant with a trailing "Next" action button.

### 💄 UI Improvements
- Consistent spacing, padding, and icon sizing across all AppBar types.
- Added support for `PreferredSize bottomWidget` and `EdgeInsets appBarInnerMargin` in `buildHomeAppbar` for dynamic layout flexibility.

### 🧼 Cleanup
- Improved documentation with usage examples and detailed parameter descriptions.
- Removed unnecessary keys and parameters like `faucetIconKey` for simplification.
- All predefined `TextStyle` entries in `CoconutTypography` now include consistent `height` values for better vertical rhythm and layout consistency.
